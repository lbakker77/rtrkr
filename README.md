## About
This project is mainly intended as a practice project to try out new things (e.g., Angular signals and signal store, Spring Modultih). Nevertheless, the project aims to be production-ready and will be deployed in the near future. Many smaller projects and articles written about technology and how to make things work often have a demo-ware character, which is not always helpful and can potentially be misleading.

Re-Tracker is a responsive web application designed to track the completion dates of activities and schedule reminders based on their execution dates. It uses Java Spring Boot for the backend and Angular for the frontend.

### Key Features: 

- **Task Logging**: Users can log tasks and mark them as completed, with automatic recording of completion dates.

- **Reminder Scheduling**: Users can set recurrant reminders based on actual execution dates. Manual scheduling is also possible.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to work seamlessly on various devices, providing an optimal user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

### Tech Stack
